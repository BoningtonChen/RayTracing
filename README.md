## About WalnutAppTemplate
- Description\
This is a simple app template for Walnut - unlike the example within the Walnut repository, this keeps Walnut as an external submodule and is much more sensible for actually building applications. See the Walnut repository for more details.
- Getting Started\
Once you've cloned, you can customize the `premake5.lua` and `WalnutApp/premake5.lua` files to your liking (eg. change the name from "WalnutApp" to something else). Once you're happy, run `scripts/Setup.bat` to generate Visual Studio 2022 solution/project files. Your app is located in the `WalnutApp/` directory, which some basic example code to get you going in `WalnutApp/src/WalnutApp.cpp`. I recommend modifying that WalnutApp project to create your own application, as everything should be setup and ready to go.
